# Mondrian-Gridscape-CSS-Grid-Artwork
A tribute to Piet Mondrian’s neoplasticism using HTML and CSS Grid. Features only primary colors—red, yellow, blue—with black and white, arranged in strict vertical and horizontal lines. No images, no JavaScript. Just pure CSS logic and responsive design echoing Mondrian's minimalist elegance.
